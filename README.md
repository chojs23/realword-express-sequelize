> ### [Express.js + sequelize] codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.

### [Demo](https://demo.realworld.io/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **[Express.js +sequelize]** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[Express.js + sequelize]** community styleguides & best practices.
